| **Core Mechanism**     | Based on P2P technology, enables direct connection between Android devices and the PC server, eliminating the need for a central relay server. |
| **Mobile Backup**      | The Android App can directly backup files like photos to the PC server.                                                                      |
| **File Browsing**      | Browse pictures and files already backed up to the PC from the Android App.                                                                 |
| **Permission Management** | The PC server can set access permissions for different folders, enabling partial file sharing.                                                 |
| **Connection Authentication** | Authentication and connection between devices is managed through a Token.                                                                   |
| **Activation Method**  | After generating a Token, it might be necessary to contact the author (e.g., via WeChat) to activate the direct connection from the PC server to the Android App. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Steps

1.  **Run the PC server and create a new Token**: First, run the server program on the PC acting as the storage server and generate a Token for authentication.
2.  **Save the Token in the Android App**: Then, enter or save this Token in the Android App on the phone.
3.  **Contact the author to activate the connection**: Finally, you may need to **contact the author** (perhaps via WeChat or other methods) to **activate** the direct connection channel from the PC server to the Android App. This step might involve backend configuration or authorization.
